ION SERIES by takashi KOKUBO - Oasis Of The Wind II ～ A Story Of Forest And Water ～

---

One day, deep in the ION forest I found a small spring.  
As serene water wells up endlessly, the new powers which were preserved by the forest begin to move.

A drop of rain, then a thunder rips the sky apart.  
In the middle of a sudden thunderstorm, my mind drifts back to that long-gone summer day, the days of unlimited possibilities.

The ION forest's small spring, the stream, the rain, they are all but an ever changing forms of water.
Water that circulates the earth become revived in the forest.  
Invigorating the land and nurturing life. 
I feel an endless affection for this beautiful blue planet, which continues to shine for millions of years.

--or--

One day,
I found a small spring
in the depths of Ion.
As its pure water endlessly gushed forth,
so too did a nascent power, hitherto held within the forest, begin its course.

Rain falls in drops. Lightning sunders the firmament.
Amidst a sudden thunderstorm, I trace my own memories.
―That distant summer day―
That time so filled with endless possibility.

This small spring of Ion, the gurgling brook, the rain:
water, in as many forms as it may take.
Water - that which makes a circuit of the world itself -
is reborn within this forest.
Moistening the soil
and fostering life...
Upon this planet, blue and beautiful,
enduring untold millions of years in its splendor,
I am to feel, without limit,
a helpless devotion.

## youtube comments

> I feel like this was created by a man who had no ego. someone who genuinely wanted to serve others and bring them to a state of calmness through his art. Listening to this album felt like the artist made it specifically for me. He wasnt trying to impress with his technical skill (even though its obviously there) rather he used his ability to serve the purpose of making something extremely enjoyable to the listener. I aspire to create something like this one day.

> it's music with no ego.  It's just for the listener.

> 幽玄 "Yugen"-Japanese term describing a state of awareness of the universe that evokes an emotion too powerful to describe in words. I find it can be at least mildly experienced through the sounds in this video
