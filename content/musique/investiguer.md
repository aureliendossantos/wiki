La chaine [should be asleep](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RVESJTf_zSaFB8qGoxOnA) dont je suis déjà tombé sur deux supers albums d'ambient japonaise.

> Brian Eno - Check out Ambient 1 - Music for airports & Apollo - Atmospheres & Soundtracks for a taste but he was pretty prolific as you can see on discogs.com

> Eno is perhaps the most important ambient artist ever, but imo, not the best. Check out Hakobune, Chihei Hatakeyama, and Endurance. All making some amazing ambient music these days.
