# By default, saving a post in the CMS interface pushes a commit directly to the publication branch specified in backend. However, you also have the option to enable the Editorial Workflow, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To do this, add the following line:
publish_mode: editorial_workflow

media_folder: "static/images/uploads" # Media files will be stored in the repo
public_folder: "/images/uploads" # The src attribute for uploaded media

collections:
  - name: "page" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
    label: "Page" # Used in the UI
    folder: "content" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
    slug: "{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    nested:
      depth: 100 # max depth to show in the collection tree
    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
      - label: Title
